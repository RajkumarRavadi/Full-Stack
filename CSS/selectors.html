<!--
    In css we color and modify the look of a plain HTML page
    to do that first we need to seclet the element to which we want to add color or change design
    this process of selecting element to which we want to modify is known as selector

    we have different kinds of selectors in CSS

    ID              --- #id
    ELEMENT         --- element
    CLASS           --- .classname
    ELEMENT,ELEMENT --- firsrele,secondele  
    ELEMENT.CLASS   --- firstele.classname
    ALL ELEMENTS    --- *
